# CemrgApp
CemrgApp is an MITK based framework extended with specialised image analysis and computer vision research software for:

+ Atrial Fibrosis quantification
+ Cardiac Wall Strain Calculations
+ Cardiac Wall Thickness Calculations
+ Wireless Endocardial Pacing Optimisation
+ Cardiac Motion Measurement Tools

The executable binaries can be downloaded for: 
+ **macOS** Mojave (10.14) There is still not support for Catalina (10.15)
+ **Linux** Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. 

## Specialised software requirements
To run all of CemrgApp's specialised modules, such as the machine learning pipeline for atrial fibrosis 
quantification, **Docker** is required to be installed on the user's computer. This can be downloaded from: 
+ [Docker for macOS.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) Simple installation and running.
+ [Docker for Linux.](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) You need to provide access to Docker. Instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) _WARNING: This will give root access to docker_
